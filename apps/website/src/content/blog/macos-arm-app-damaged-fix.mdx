If you are on macOS ARM (Apple Silicon) and IPTVnator shows **"app is damaged and can't be opened"**, use this quick fix.

## TL;DR

<TerminalBlock title="Terminal">
$ xattr -c /Applications/IPTVnator.app
</TerminalBlock>

## Why this happens

IPTVnator is currently not code-signed for macOS. After download, Gatekeeper adds a quarantine attribute, and macOS can block launch with a generic "damaged" message.

To distribute a fully signed and notarized macOS app, Apple requires an active Apple Developer subscription (currently **$99/year**). As an open-source project, IPTVnator does not currently use that signing pipeline.

## What the command does

The command above removes the quarantine attribute from the app bundle:

- It does **not** modify IPTVnator binaries
- It tells your Mac to trust the app you intentionally downloaded
- It is the standard local workaround for unsigned apps

  Only run this command for apps you trust and downloaded from a trusted source.
