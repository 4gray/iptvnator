We are excited to launch the official IPTVnator website and developer blog!

## What is IPTVnator?

IPTVnator is a free, open-source IPTV player application that supports M3U/M3U8 playlists, Xtream Codes API, and Stalker portals. It runs as a desktop application (via Electron) and as a Progressive Web App directly in your browser.

## What to expect from this blog

This blog will be the home for:

- **Release notes** for new versions
- **Tutorials** on how to get the most out of IPTVnator
- **Roadmap updates** so you know what features are coming next
- **Technical deep dives** into the architecture and development process

## Get involved

IPTVnator is open source and we welcome contributions! Check out our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/4gray/iptvnator) to get started.
