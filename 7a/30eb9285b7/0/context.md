### Prompt 4

in main 3 feature cars especially the icons and card style looks boring, aroudn the icon is a lot of whitespace, can we improve that? maybe we can put them into card background or use some styling effect, maybe rotate icons also easily. some cool and elegant look and feel, which would fit into general style of the landing page, but make card look more attractive. use frontend design skill to use proper stle and typography.

### Prompt 5

what do you think about the other cards that are auto rotated, should we also adapt style of them? maybe also icons and position, or should they look diffferent and it's fine?

### Prompt 6

for the 4 top cards, what do you thing about putting the icons more as kind of background/watermark, big over the card in backgrand, gradient transparency, maybe rotated and only partly visible? would it fit into general landing page design?

### Prompt 7

"Carousel Cards (8 secondary features) - Rotated accent-tinted icon boxes (±4°) with ring border and accent dot" - remove that rotation from icons
