## How to Build

Requirements: Node.js with npm

1. Clone this repository and install project dependencies:
   ```
   $ npm install
   ```

2. Build the application for your platform using one of the following commands:
   ```
   # Linux
   $ npm run electron:build:linux
   ```

   ```
   # macOS
   $ npm run electron:build:mac
   ```

   ```
   # Windows
   $ npm run electron:build:windows
   ```

These commands will generate distributable assets in the `release` folder based on the electron-builder configuration stored in `electron-builder.json` and `package.json`. For custom configurations, please refer to the [electron-builder API documentation](https://www.electron.build/).

*Note: Cross-platform building may not be supported. [Read more](https://www.electron.build/multi-platform-build)*

## Development

First, install all required dependencies:

  ```
  $ npm install
  ```

To develop the application in both PWA and Electron modes, run:

  ```
  $ npm run start
  ```

This will open the Electron version in a separate window, while the PWA version will be available at http://localhost:4200.

To run only the Angular app without Electron, use:

  ```
  $ npm run serve
  ```
