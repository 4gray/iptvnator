# Self-hosted IPTVnator

The self-hosted image contains both pieces required for the browser PWA:

- Angular PWA static files served by nginx
- The monorepo `web-backend` Express app proxied under `/api`

The historical standalone `4gray/iptvnator-backend` image is no longer needed
for the default Docker deployment.

## Run With Docker Compose

From the repository root:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up --build -d
```

The ready-to-run compose file is [`docker-compose.yml`](./docker-compose.yml).
By default the app is available at <http://localhost:4333>. No additional
environment variables, backend repository checkout, or separate backend
container are required for the default local deployment.

## Build The Image

```bash
docker build -t 4gray/iptvnator -f docker/Dockerfile .
```

The image build runs:

```bash
pnpm nx build web --configuration=pwa
pnpm nx build web-backend
```

## Runtime Configuration

The container writes `/usr/share/nginx/html/assets/app-config.js` on startup.
That file sets `window.__IPTVNATOR_CONFIG__.BACKEND_URL`, which the PWA reads
before it creates `PwaService`.

These variables are supported by the Docker image. The compose file sets the
safe local defaults shown below.

| Variable                                 | Default                 | Purpose                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `BACKEND_URL`                            | `/api`                  | Browser-facing backend URL used by the PWA. Keep `/api` for the bundled nginx proxy.                               |
| `CLIENT_URL`                             | `http://localhost:4333` | Allowed browser origin for backend CORS. Use the public URL when hosting behind a reverse proxy. Multiple origins can be comma-separated. |
| `PORT`                                   | `3000`                  | Internal Express backend port. nginx proxy config is rendered from the template to match it at startup.            |
| `IPTVNATOR_PROXY_ALLOW_PRIVATE_NETWORKS` | `0`                     | Set to `1` or `true` only for trusted local/LAN deployments that intentionally proxy private network IPTV or mock endpoints. |
| `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`                    | unset                   | Optional Node.js CA bundle path for providers using private certificate authorities. Mount the CA file into the container and set this path. |

The web backend proxy accepts only `http` and `https` provider URLs. The PWA
first registers provider URLs through `/provider-targets`, then uses the
returned `targetId` for playlist, Xtream, and Stalker proxy calls. The backend
blocks loopback, private, link-local, and reserved network targets by default so
a publicly exposed instance cannot be used as a generic internal-network
fetcher. If you enable `IPTVNATOR_PROXY_ALLOW_PRIVATE_NETWORKS=1`, keep the
instance restricted to trusted users.

For providers that use private certificate authorities, keep TLS validation
enabled and pass the CA bundle to Node:

```yaml
services:
  iptvnator:
    volumes:
      - ./ca.pem:/etc/ssl/private/provider-ca.pem:ro
    environment:
      NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS: /etc/ssl/private/provider-ca.pem
```

The entrypoint renders the nginx config from `docker/nginx.conf`, starts the
backend, waits for `/health`, and only then starts nginx. The nginx config
serves the PWA with SPA fallback, avoids caching `assets/app-config.js`, and
proxies `/api/*` to the internal backend. The Dockerfile and compose file both
define a health check against `/api/health`.

## Local Validation

```bash
pnpm nx test web-backend
pnpm nx build web --configuration=pwa --skip-nx-cache
pnpm nx build web-backend
pnpm nx run web-e2e:e2e -- --project=chromium --grep @self-hosted
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml config
```
